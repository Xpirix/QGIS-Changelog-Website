      "description": "The QGIS Project proudly announces the release of QGIS 3.44, a momentous release that marks the culmination of the QGIS 3 series. This release arrives within a vibrant and ever-expanding ecosystem of free and open-source geospatial tools, libraries, and community support that empowers users worldwide. Building upon the solid foundations of previous releases, QGIS 3.44 provides a stable and refined experience for all users as the project transitions to the modern Qt6 framework with the upcoming release of [QGIS 4.0](https://blog.qgis.org/2025/04/17/qgis-is-moving-to-qt6-and-launching-qgis-4-0/) in October 2025.\r\n\r\nAs the final feature release of the QGIS 3.x branch, this version ensures a reliable environment for existing workflows, and plugin developers can anticipate a smooth transition between releases, as QGIS 4.0 will retain deprecated APIs to minimize compatibility efforts and allow the ecosystem to evolve alongside the core application.\r\n\r\nWhile focused on stability and refinement, the release still includes a range of notable enhancements that refine workflows and empower users in their geospatial endeavors. Such enhancements include refinements to database management and connectivity, improved data provider flexibility, and new project settings. Old favourites such as the Processing toolbox and QGIS Expressions also see their fair share of improvements, and cartographic capabilities get a boost with new labelling and layout updates.\r\n\r\nFor a whirlwind tour of all the new functionalities introduced, you can view the [highlight reel video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a02yaDKAiE).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a02yaDKAiE\"><img src=\"https://img.youtube.com/vi/5a02yaDKAiE/0.jpg\" /></a>\r\n\r\nQGIS is a community effort, and we would like to extend a big thank you to the developers, documenters, testers, and the many folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so) to make these releases possible. From the QGIS community, we hope you enjoy this release!
